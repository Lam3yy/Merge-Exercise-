# Merge-Exercise-
purposefully creating and solving a merge conflict


To create a branch use - git branch the name of the new branch
Difference between fast forward and recursive : 
Fast forward - itâ€™s pretty straight forward, when git can tell what order commits happen in. No conflicts
Recursive - the commits are not chronological so there are conflicts.
To change to another branch use : git checkout name of branch you want to change to
How to delete a branch - firstly, you will need to be on a separate branch from the one you are wanting to delete. Then you will use git branch -d name of the branch you want to delete.
Merge conflicts occur when committs happen at different times on two branches, when they are not chronological git will need us to pick which commit we would like to use BEFORE it can merge the branches.
